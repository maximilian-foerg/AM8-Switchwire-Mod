# ...aNET with out a TAP?!
Hi friends of this awesome mod for the AM8,

due to my interest in using the [Voron Tap](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap) on this im working on a modification for the AM8-Switchwire-Mod allowing the **nearly** untouched Tap to be mounted on the X-Carriage.
Furthermore a change to the printbed is required due to the bed rigidity the Tap requires. I'll keep this updated.

Things to change:
- X-Carriage
- Printbed

**This mod is currently unusable due to missing bed modifications im working on. Using the tap with the original Anet or Switchwire bed will lead to eventually broken printbeds or terrible Tap performance!**
